# Customer-Segmentation-using-k-Means-clustering

Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the data from a given eCommerce platform, web application, or online game and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.

Cohort analysis is a tool to measure user engagement over time. It helps to know whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or is only appearing to improve because of growth.

This project aims to perform cohort analysis of customers and their behavior during the lifespan of a product/organization. This is achieved using Unsupervised Learning techniques - namely k-Means clustering methodologies.
A metric is developed - called 'RFM', which is enables us to perform the analysis within each cluster on several parameters. This helps in predicting and understanding the cohort trend, which helps in better understanding the customers and their approach towards a product/organization.
